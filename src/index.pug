                            Sugarcane is one of the most widely-grown commercial crops in India: cultivated on almost 
                            **5 million hectares** of land in 2017. The sugar industry is the second largest in the country: 
                            contributing to around **6%** of the agricultural GDP; this puts sugarcane among the most economically 
                            important crops in the country.
                        p.
                        :markdown-it(html)
                            The sucrose present in the stem of the sugarcane exists in a dynamic equilibrium between its synthesis 
                            and utilisation. Following the harvest of the crop, this equilibrium is disturbed. Invertase – an enzyme 
                            present in the cells –  breaks down sucrose into its components: fructose and glucose, resulting in a 
                            reduction in the amount of sucrose in the stem. Ultimately the sugar recovery rate sees a reduction by 
                            anywhere between **2%** to **10%**.
                        p.
                            Our project involves targeting this enzyme. We propose to introduce genetically-modified bacteria, suspended 
                            in our novel polymer-based inoculant, into the sugarcane matrix post-harvest. The bacteria would exhibit 
                            anti-invertase activity regulated by the amount of fructose and glucose inside the sugarcane in a continuous 
                            and controlled manner.

                            more hurts my eyes, reducing it saturation makes orange lose its effect and reducing 
                            brightness makes it dull. Btw, scroll up for an inverted Indian flag.
