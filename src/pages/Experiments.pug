        Most of the degradation of LB, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Sorbate is expected to be done by the second clarifier stage. 
        We will be trying to replicate this in the following experiments and characterizing to show that they are considerably degraded. 
        And, Bentonite is assumed to be removed in the first clarifier stage as filter cake along with other residues.
        
        # Emphasis
        This is regular text.

        **This is bold text.**
        __This is also bold text.__

        *This is italic text.*
        _This is also italix text.*

        ***This text is bold and italic both.***
        ___This text is bold and italic both.___

        ~~Strikethrough~~

        # Lists
        1. This is item one.
        1. This is item two.
        1. It's okay to number every item as 1.
            * This is a nested list.
            * Use asterisk for an unordered list,
            * Further nesting?
            + Plus sign also works.
            - And so does minus.
        1. ~~Birds aren't real.~~

        # Tables

        This is a regular paragraph, which precedes the table.
        When you want to insert a table, indent one level back and specify the plugin.
        Then indent inside again and start writing the table.

    :markdown-it(html plugins=['markdown-it-multimd-table'])
        | This is | the table | header row |
        | ------  | --------- | ---------- |
        | 1       | 2         | 3          |
        | 4       | 5         | 6          |
        [Table 1: Caption goes here.]

    :markdown-it(html)
        And when you're done, go back to the regular markdown filter.
